I am an academic and researcher deeply immersed in the domains of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Natural Language Processing (NLP) since 2002. Throughout my academic journey, I have been fortunate to straddle the sector of academia and industry, fostering a balanced perspective that bridges theoretical depth with practical application.


Fueled by a genuine passion for education and exploration, I've had the honour of guiding and inspiring students throughout my journey, nurturing their intellectual growth. This dedication has also provided me with the unique opportunity to collaborate closely with the industry. In these collaborations, I've been fortunate to work alongside some of the brightest minds, contributing to the development of AI-driven products within the legal domain for the past 15 years.


During this time, my focus has been on applied research and product innovation that resonates within the legal landscape. By marrying technological advancements with legal intricacies, I have been involved in shaping AI-enabled solutions that address critical challenges and opportunities within the legal domain.


In my current research journey, I find myself delving into the intriguing domain of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Generative AI. With a sense of humility, I strive to understand the vast potential, inherent limitations, and nuanced risks that accompany these models in the creation of transformative products. This exploration fuels my commitment to responsible and thoughtful AI integration.


My scholarly pursuits have resulted in a collection of research contributions shared through publications and presentations that aim to bridge academic insights with practical implications. I am humbled by the opportunity to engage with diverse audiences, sharing perspectives that foster a deeper understanding of the transformative power of AI, ML, and NLP.


As I continue to navigate this journey, I am driven by a genuine curiosity to expand the boundaries of AI understanding and application. With an unwavering commitment to knowledge dissemination, I invite you to explore my work and join me in the ongoing exploration of AI's impact on our world.
